  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath, supervised by
    <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/mapamgc/">Alexander Cox</a> (Bath) and
    <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/sigridkn">Sigrid Källblad</a> (KTH).
    I obtained my MSc in Financial Mathematics with distinction from University College London (UCL).
    Prior to that, I completed a BSc in Honors Mathematics at New York University Shanghai (NYUSH).
    From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a full-time volunteer teacher at a primary school in a rural mountainous village in Yunnan, China.

  <!-- Research Areas -->
  <h2>Research Interests:</h2>
  <p>
    My research interests lie in stochastic analysis and optimal control theory. More specifically, I focus on controlled measure-valued processes and controlled filtering problems. I am also interested in numerical methods for stochastic optimal control problems, particularly machine-learning-based approaches. More recently, I have become interested in probabilistic AI and reinforcement learning. I am also fascinated by rough path theory and stochastic analysis/optimisation/numerical methods on manifolds.
